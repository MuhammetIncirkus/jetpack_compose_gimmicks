I have a small app here that does nothing other than display a few pictures. 
The app is only used to understand and use Jetpack Compose. 

The app contains among others:
LazyRow, LazyColumn, HorizontalMultiBrowseCarousel, Scaffold, Switch, Slider, ElevatedCard as well as AnimatedContent, AnimatedVisibility and Crossfade
